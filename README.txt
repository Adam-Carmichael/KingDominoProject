== Description ==
Simple KingDomino board game optimized for four players. Able to create 
a board via placing dominos. Dominos are made up of two tiles, which 
can be placed on a 5x5 grid of invisible buttons. All basic rules 
apply, buttons are occasionally shown when placing tiles to indicate 
viable tile placements. The game ends when the dominos in the deck run 
out or the player's board can no longer fit any more dominos.

== How to Play == 
Run the program by double-clicking the executable in the main folder 
"KingDominoProject". Opens start menu on startup, where you can either 
choose to start a game or close the program by left-clicking the 
"Start Game" and the "Quit" button respectively. Once the "Start Game" 
button is clicked a new page will be displayed. Along the top of the 
window there will be text spelling "Your Board". Additionally,
there will be text for 3 other players' boards. The row of text right 
below these reads (from left to right) "Choose Domino 1", "Choose 
Domino 2", "Choose Domino 3", and "Choose Domino 4". The two rows of images
below these "Choose Domin" buttons are the dominos corresponding to the 
buttons above them. When you click one of the buttons, the respective 
domino will be shown along the side of the screen. Click either one of
the tiles to place them on your board. Once you have clicked either button,
4 buttons next to the castle tile will be shown. These buttons are the positions
in which you can place the selected tile. Once you have chosen an area to 
place the tile, buttons similar to the previous ones will appear around the tile.
After you have placed both tiles, the next player will take their
turn choosing a domino. This process will repeat until the deck that is being 
drawn from runs out of dominos or your 5x5 board can no longer fit 
any more dominos.
