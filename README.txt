== Description ==
Simple KingDomino board game optimized for one player. Able to create 
a board via placing dominos. Dominos are made up of two tiles, which 
can be placed on a 5x5 grid of invisible buttons. All basic rules 
apply, buttons are occasionally shown when placing tiles to indicate 
viable tile placements. The game ends when the dominos in the deck run 
out or the player's board can no longer fit any more dominos.

== How to Play == 
Run the program by double-clicking the executable in the main folder 
"KingDominoProject". Opens start menu on startup, where you can either 
choose to start a game or close the program by left-clicking the 
"Start Game" and the "Quit" button respectively. Once the "Start Game" 
button is clicked a new page will be displayed. Along the top of the 
window there will be text spelling "Your Board". The row of text right 
below this reads (from left to right) "Choose Domino 1", "Choose 
Domino 2", "Choose Domino 3", and "Choose Domino 4". The two rows of 
images below these buttons are the dominos corresponding to the 
buttons above them. When you click one of the buttons, the respective 
domino will be shown in the middle of the screen. Below each of the 
two tiles of the domino buttons labeled "Tile1" and "Tile2" will 
appear. Click either one of these buttons to place the tile above it 
on your board (shown below, now consisting of only one castle tile).
Once you have clicked either button, 4 buttons next to the castle 
tile will be shown. These buttons (from the top and going clockwise: 
3/4, 4/3, 3/2, and 2/3) are the positions in which you can place the 
selected tile. Once you have chosen an area to place the tile, similar 
buttons similar to these will appear so you may place the second tile 
of the domino. After you have placed both tiles you must choose a 
domino again. This process will repeat until the deck that is being 
drawn from runs out of dominos or your 5x5 board can no longer fit 
any more dominos.
